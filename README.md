# Conway's Game of Life in Go

Implemented as a project to learn more about Go. It's a very naive version and
also probably overdesigned in some places, but it was done mostly to explore
some of Go's idioms.

To start the simulation, just type:

    go run conway.go

Any suggestions or improvements are welcome!
